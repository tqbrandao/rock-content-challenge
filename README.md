# Rock On Project 🤘

This is a React JS desktop application (at least for now, will make it mobile friendly soon) which retrieves data from two API's (Youtube and Ticketmaster) and displays the most popular videos and information about any artist or band.

## Implementation

### 👨‍💻 Framework / Library

React JS with Vite

### 🎨 Styling

CSS Modules and BEM (Block Element Modifier) for CSS naming standardization

### 💾 Tests

Unit tests with Jest, Vitest and React's Testing Library

## Usage

You can clone the repo or download the ZIP file. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

Rename the ".env.example" file to ".env" and set variables with your own API Keys (Youtube and Ticketmaster).
Finally:

```bash
npm run dev
```
